HW #19

A hashmap (or treemap) implements the map interface, can have duplicate values, and is stored as keys and values.

A hashset (or treeset) implements the set interface, cannot have duplicate values, and only stores one object.

Internally, hashmap is implemented using linked lists. It is not ordered.

Internally, treemap is implemented based on a red-black tree structure. It is ordered by keys.

Hashmap is faster than treemap.

Java's build in heap data structure is called PriorityQueue.
